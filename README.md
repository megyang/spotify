1. Brief summary of what your project does: 
   I made a simpler version of Spotify with a color scheme that I liked more (emulating cherry blossoms and/or strawberry matcha!!). It has basic functionality of being
   able to make an account, upload songs, play the songs you uploaded, skip, mute, favorite and search songs that you uploaded yourself. 
2. Which features you chose to include: 
   I included user registration/login, components, minimal animation, and integration with database. 
3. How much time you spent developing this project:
    around 15-20 hours.
4. Take a working video of your project. Include the YouTube or video link:
